# Trying to recode chess

I want to learn to apply real life logic and set rules into code so I decided to try to code chess. I also wanted to learn how to use Python Class() objects so it's very object oriented
I am only making this README so when I randomly open this one time I will have motivation to finish this.

My idea is that this will have a file defining the Piece as a class and then a Board as a class. Then I would create different scripts, one for reading PGN files or another form of notation and creaate a .gif file of the game, similar to what chess.com provides in their website.
Another script will be used for actually playing chess. For now I think I will hold off on this since I am not familiar with packages that seamlessly integrate user clicking and dreagging something inside of a UI environment but maybe pygame would work.
Eventually this incorporate AI and I could start training an AI model to learn how to play chess.
I might use a heavily supervised learning approach because why would I re-invent the fucking wheel, I'm not making the next Stockfish.
Maybe I could make an algorithm that will be able to give me an eval bar and maybe even do game review for me.
wait am pretty much just copying chess.com features.

**well it's not like they own the concept of playing a chess game and analyzing it ???**

I can make game review that I don't have to pay **TENS OF EUROS** per year to analyze a game people played before electricity was even discovered.

anyways this is less of a README document and more of a GET UP OFF YOUR ASS AND FINISH THIS PROJECT reminder if I ever click on this


THis will probably never get finished.
