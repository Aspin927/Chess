# Trying to recode chess

I want to learn to apply real life logic and set rules into code so I decided to try to code chess. I also wanted to learn how to use Python Class() objects so it's very object oriented
I am only making this README so when I randomly open this one time I will have motivation to finish this.

My idea is that this will have a file defining the Piece as a class and then a Board as a class. I am literally just making shit up and seeing if I can make it work.

THis will probably never get finished.
